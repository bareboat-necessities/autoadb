This command-line tool allows to execute a command whenever a new device is connected to adb.

For example, to execute printf on device connection:

autoadb printf 'Device connected\n'

{} replaces the serial of the device detected:

autoadb printf 'Device %s connected\n' '{}'

It may be used to start scrcpy:

autoadb scrcpy -s '{}'
